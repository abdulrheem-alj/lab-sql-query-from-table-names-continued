    "Example SQL queries for retrieving meaningful data\n",

    "Context-specific logic for business operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we tested GPT’s ability to generate valid and relevant SQL queries based on these contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Findings & Observations\n",
    "# 1. Video Games Context\n",
    "GPT successfully generated clean tables like Games, Players, and Scores. The queries for top players and highest scores were accurate and logically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Restaurant Context\n",
    "The system produced appropriate tables (Menu, Customers, Orders) and accurate queries for the most expensive menu items, customers by city, and top spenders\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Bookstore Context\n",
    "The queries for top-spending customers, highest ordered books, and high-priced books made sense and were valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Supermarket Context\n",
    "The queries for top-spending customers, highest ordered products, and high-priced products were all relevant and valid. They captured the right data, reflecting the business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lessons Learned\n",
    "Prompt Clarity Matters:\n",
    "Precise, well-structured, domain-specific prompts result in more reliable and accurate SQL generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk of Hallucination in Text Outputs:\n",
    "While SQL generation was reliable, free-text generations mixed facts and fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Always Validate SQL:\n",
    "It’s important to review both the table definitions and generated queries to make sure they match in terms of field names and logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This experiment proved that GPT can reliably generate structured SQL schemas and queries when guided with clear and specific instructions. The main issues appeared in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-text generations (hallucinations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema migration errors when switching domains\n",

    "For future improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use schema validators\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforce stricter schema-query consistency\n",

    "Add factual verification for free-text outputs"
